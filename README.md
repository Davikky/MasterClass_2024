# MasterClass_2023
Repository for the Infineon MasterClass workshop on applications of quantum computing. 

To follow this workshop you will need to install python on your device. If you are not familiar with this programing language here is a source that gives first steps towards installing it and getting started: 

https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/

The workshop will follow a presentation and a jupyter notebook where you will do some exercise and run some prebuild code. In case you are not familiar with jupyter and you want to learn a little bit before the workshop (this is not necessary though), you can follow the first steps from this link:

Make sure all libraries in requierement.txt are installed. To install the requierements open your terminal and use the command 

pip install -r requirements.txt

In case you are more familiar with python and know how to work with virtual environment it would be recomended to create on for this project. This is optional and it is only in case you have other open projects with qiskit.
